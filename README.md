# Fake-News-Detection-using-Machine-Learning
This model detects fake news in English and Hindi and was my major project in our 3rd semester.
The dataset link for the same : https://www.kaggle.com/code/therealsampat/fake-news-detection
We were unable to find a Hindi news dataset so we translate the Hindi news into English using Google Translate API and then carry on with the fake news detection with the new English news.
We used Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest and Gradient Boost Classifier Algorithm
